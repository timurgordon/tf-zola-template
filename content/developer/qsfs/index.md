## Quantum-Safe Storage 

An optimized filesystem frontend for Zdb, with built-in archival features. Zero-DB is a super fast and efficient always append database supporting a subset of the popular Redis protocol. It has superior write performance on hard disk and can also extend the life of solid state disks, while executing up to 50, 000 transactions per second. Zero-DB is suitable out of the box for many database applications and is a building block for advanced storage solutions.

<br />

Works together with ZStor to create a highly compatible and extremely secure storage solution, called Quantum Safe Filesystem. ZStor is a distributed and ultra secure storage backend. It compresses, encrypts, and disperses data across a set of Zdbs, to achieve strong resistance to even quantum computing attacks. Flexible configurations enable tuning according to preferences for efficiency, resiliency, and data location. Scales limitlessly and heals seamlessly.
