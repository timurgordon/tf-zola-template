Michael is a seasoned veteran with over 30 years of experience working in both the US and UK. He is a former CEO of public and private media and technology companies, most recently of NASDAQ quoted ChyronHego. He is Director and Founder of Inogesis, a London-based accelerator that enables blue-chip organizations to harness the power of disruptive technology. He is a Director of Conduce Technology, an innovative pioneer in the field of data visualisation based in California and also an Advisor and Venture Investor in Alpha Venture Partners, a technology-focused venture capital firm based in New York. Michael has served as Managing Director of Wit Soundview Ventures, COO of Data Broadcasting Corporation and Director of Financial News Network. He founded and served as Director of London-based boutique technology investment bank Stephen Rose and Partners. I fully support and endorse the the ThreeFold Foundation vision of a decentralised, sustainable and greener internet that provides lower cost computational power and connectivity to large groups of people who , until today, have been excluded from the benefits and possibilities inherent in the digital revolution.
