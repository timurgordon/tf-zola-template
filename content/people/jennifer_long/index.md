Greetings global community! Pura Vida from beautiful Costa Rica! I am Jennifer Long and I live near and work with resource poor women farmers, where we are growing food forests in our high altitude rainforest. Beautiful women, the mother of men, our mission here is to protect the land, nurture the earth, and her inhabitants. We are working toward a sustainable food production that is produced in harmony with the natural ecosystem. We grow superfoods for wellness on our very abundant small scale farms. We share and collaborate with each other and within our community. Collaboration creates prosperity. Collaboration with Threefold technology will allow us to connect our remote world with the global community. We believe this the path to a sustainable future by including the Threefold technology in our food forest farming and global distribution of our very potent rainforest products. I believe in this endeavor of the ThreeFold Foundation because it equates to actually being the 'people's internet' in that it is distributed around the world to share with the population of the planet where we decide who and what can access our information. Additionally, I believe this will be a catalyst for countries lacking in internet capability to motivate those countries to upgrade their IT so that they can utilize this system on ThreeFold to generate income for the country as well as to spread the opportunity to individuals in those same countries to use a node, cluster or even join cooperative farming efforts.
