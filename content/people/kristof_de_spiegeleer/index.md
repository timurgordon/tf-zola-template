Humanist & motivated entrepreneur, passionate to help make the world a better place. Kristof strongly believes there is need for a neutral internet owned by millions. We dream about a world where everyone can be happy, with respect for each other and the world’s resources. A world where we dare to love ourselves and we don’t have to be scared about our future. A world where we don’t need to be a product and we have learned to collaborate with openness and trust.
