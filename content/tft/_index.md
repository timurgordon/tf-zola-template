## **DECENTRALIZING THE INTERNET ECONOMY**


The People’s Internet creates an entirely new decentralized Internet economy that allows anyone to join the world’s fastest growing market – the Internet.

## **MEETING EMERGING DEMAND**


Data has become the most valuable commodity on earth, the Internet infrastructure is experiencing significant growth. While the current centralized model is facing limitations, ThreeFold can scale to the edge to service the emerging demand.

125 zetabytes of storage capacity needs to be
created to meet demand for data in the upcoming years.
That is a number with 21 zeroes!

## **THE MISSING LAYERS**


While many projects have created bits and pieces of what a decentralized Internet would look like, ThreeFold is decentralizing the entire Internet model. The blockchain world is missing this decentralized foundational layer. ThreeFold provides the peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure to interconnect the entire blockchain and web3 space.

## **THE CURRENCY OF THE DECENTRALIZED INTERNET**

TFT is a utility token that allows people to hold current and future Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. It incentivizes an open ecosystem where anyone can connect and utilize Internet capacity without any intermediaries.

<!-- section 5 (OPEN NETWORK) -->

{% row(style="center narrow") %}


## **OPEN NETWORK**

3Nodes provide Internet capacity for millions of people using ThreeFold’s Planetary Network, and you earn TFT for doing so. And because of a unique operating system, called Zero-OS, once turned on your 3Node runs by itself.

### Proof-Of-Capacity

People earn TFT as monthly income for connecting Internet capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.

### Proof-Of-Utilization

People buy TFT to store data and run applications privately on a peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure.

## **LOYALTY REWARDS**

The ThreeFold blockchain automatically scans wallets and provides up-to 60% discounts on the utilization of the ThreeFold Grid. The more TFT you hold across time, the higher the discounts.

## **A REAL UTILITY TOKEN**

TFT is minted only when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. A limited supply of 4 Billion TFT has been set to ensure the value keeps steady for the years to come with rising demand for a decentralized Internet.

<!-- section 8 (BURN AND FARM) -->

## **BURN AND FARM EQUILIBRIUM**

Burning permanently removes TFT from the circulating supply when the ThreeFold Grid gets used. It ensures a positive impact on pricing while ensuring rewards for all current and future nodes.
