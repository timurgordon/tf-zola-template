## SUPPORTING AN INTERCONNECTED WORLD

Internet access is a human right and it can change everything for the lives of people as an infinite source of tools and information. Our technology was designed to scale the People’s Internet anywhere electricity and bandwidth are present.

## EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO BE SOVEREIGN

## WE’VE COME A LONG WAY, <br> **AND WE’RE JUST GETTING STARTED**

After setting world records in Internet storage and cloud automation technologies throughout the past 20 years, some of our co-founders decided to start from scratch and build a new Internet infrastructure that is universally open source and peer-to-peer.

<br>

And we’re aiming for new heights. The People’s Internet will turn into a DAO in 2022, inviting developers and enterprises from all around the world to collaborate on the decentralization of everything that is digital, and beyond.
